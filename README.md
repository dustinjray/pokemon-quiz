# Pokémon Naming Quiz
[Play the Game](https://dustinjray.github.io/pokemon-quiz)
## Inspiration
I've always been a fan of those Buzzfeed quizzes where you have to name as many _____ things or characters as you can in a set amount of time. My biggest complaint with those has always been that they don't REALLY provide enough time for you to name every character if you really DID know all of them. So I made my own. 

## How to Play
* If you want the full 25 minute time limit, just start typing. Otherwise, click your desired time and then the game will start when you begin typing.
* There are NO regional forms; i.e. "galarian slowpoke"
* There are NO Mega evolutions
* For pokemon that have their gender in their name, use (name)-m or (name)-f, excluding the parenthesis.
* You can end the game prematurely by clicking the "end" button.
* You MUST click restart before attempting to play again.

## Features
### Correct Guesses
Sprites of correctly guessed Pokémon will appear in the box above the text input. I thought this would be more helpful than a text list of the ones guessed, but maybe it isn't.
### Missed Pokémon
After the game, a list of all the Pokémon you didn't guess will appear below the game area. Study hard and try again!
### Auto-Submit Answers
This may be annoying for Pokémon that share parts of their names, but overall I believe it's beneficial. As soon as the game detects that you have entered the name of a Pokémon that you have NOT previously guessed, the text field will clear, and you can keep typing. There are a lot of them, after all.
### Variable Time Limits
I know not everyone wants to take 25 minutes to play this kind of game, but that really is about the time someone who knew every single Pokémon's name and had average typing ability would need. Because of this, there are buttons available that shorten the time of the game.
