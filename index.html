				<h1>How Many Pokémon Can You Name?</h1>
				<div class="card instructions">
					<p class="intro">There are a lot of Pokémon. Like. Way more than a ton. I know I've missed several
						generations of the games, so I definitely don't know all of them, but how many do you think you
						can name?</p>
					<p class="intro">According to Google, the average typing speed is 42 words per minute with an
						accuracy rate of 92%. Theoretically it should take someone about 21 minutes minimum to name them all,
						then. But there will be three buttons for you to select your desired time limit.</p>
					<p class="intro">So when you're ready, hit the button below to bring up the game. The timer won't
						start until you begin typing. There's no time to worry about hitting enter, I'll take care of
						that for you. Capitalization doesn't count but punctuation does, <i>(hint hint)</i> If you get
						bored, you can hit the end button to see the final results and check out which ones you
						missed. Pressing the restart button will reset the game, waiting for you to begin typing before
						the timer starts. </p>
					<p class="intro">P.S. Don't try to play this on your phone. It just won't end well (and may not work
						at all, I didn't test it because that seemed ridiculous.)</p>
					<p class="intro">Good luck. You're going to need it.</p>
					<button class="start">Start</button>
