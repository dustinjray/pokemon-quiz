				<h1>How Many Pokémon Can You Name?</h1>
				<div class="card">
					<p class="intro">There are a lot of Pokémon. Like. Way more than a ton. I know I've missed several
						generations of the games, so I definitely don't know all of them, but how many do you think you
						can name?</p>
					<p class="intro">According to Google, the average typing speed is 42 words per minute with an
						accuracy rate of 92%. So it would, theoretically, take you at least 21 minutes, on average, to
						type all their names out. I know BuzzFeed only gives you like 8 minutes to accomplish such a
						task, but I'm going to be generous, since many of us are still stuck at home with little to do
						right now, and give you 25 minutes.</p>
					<p class="intro">That's enough minutes for about 160 extra Pokémon!</p>
					<p class="intro">So when you're ready, hit the button below to bring up the game. The timer won't
						start until you begin typing. There's no time to worry about hitting enter, I'll take care of
						that for you. Capitalization doesn't count but punctuation does, <i>(hint hint)</i> If you get
						bored, you can hit the give up button to see the final results and check out which ones you
						missed. Pressing the replay button will reset the game, waiting for you to begin typing before
						the timer starts. </p>
					<p class="intro">P.S. Don't try to play this on your phone. It just won't end well (and may not work
						at all, I didn't test it because that seemed ridiculous.)</p>
					<p class="intro">Good luck. You're going to need it.</p>
					<button class="start">Start</button>
